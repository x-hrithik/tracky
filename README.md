# Movie/Show Tracker

A simple Movie/Show tracker web app built in C++ using the Crow web framework. (https://crowcpp.org/master/)
First project with C++ (first real programming project in general)
The goal of this project is really to just get my self understanding C++ even just a little bit.
I'm getting help from a friend too.
